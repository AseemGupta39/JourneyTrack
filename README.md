# JourneyTrack<hr>
- Designed an interactive C++ application for efficient route discovery in a directed/undirected transit system, utilizing Dijkstra's
Algorithm and DFS.
- Implemented core functionalities for dynamic station management, shortest path computation, and visualization of transit networks.
- Optimized algorithms for real-time pathfinding, ensuring accuracy and performance in complex graph-based systems

# How to Compile files<br>And run the executables<hr>
```
g++ -c Graph_M.cpp      # Compile Graph_M.cpp
g++ -c main.cpp         # Compile main.cpp
g++ -o my_program Graph_M.o main.o   # Link object files to create executable
./my_program            # Run the executable
